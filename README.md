## ⚠️ Challenges Faced
⚡ Managing Dynamic Content:
Handling dynamic content and ensuring that the correct rating was displayed after the user made a selection was a key challenge. Initially, the ratings were not updating correctly, and the thank you message was not displaying as expected.

📱 Ensuring Responsive Design:
Creating a responsive design that looked good on all screen sizes was another challenge. Ensuring that the rating buttons and the thank you message were properly aligned and looked aesthetically pleasing across devices required careful consideration of CSS styles and layout adjustments.

💻 JavaScript Interactivity:
Implementing JavaScript interactivity to handle rating selection, button states, and conditional display logic was complex. Ensuring that the submit button only worked when a rating was selected and that the correct rating was displayed in the thank you message required careful coding and debugging.

🎨 Adding Smooth Animations:
Incorporating animations to make the interface more engaging was another challenge. This included animating the star icon, submit buttons, and the thank you heart icon.

## 🛠️ Solutions Implemented
🖱️ JavaScript Event Listeners:
Utilized JavaScript event listeners to handle user interactions. Added click event listeners to each rating button to update the active state and store the selected rating. Added a click event listener to the submit button to handle form submission and display the thank you message.

📐 Media Query and CSS Flexbox:
Used Media Query to create a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. CSS Flexbox ensured that the rating buttons and thank you message were properly aligned and visually appealing on all devices.

🎨 SCSS for Styling:
Utilized SCSS for styling to manage CSS more efficiently and maintain a clean and organized codebase. Defined variables for colors and fonts to ensure consistency and make future updates easier.

✨ Keyframe Animations:
Added keyframe animations to the star icon, submit buttons, and heart icon to make the interface more dynamic. This included scaling and rotating animations to capture user attention.
